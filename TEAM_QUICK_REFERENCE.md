## Key Principles

### ✅ What This Approach Does

1. **Tests Strategy Execution**: How well can each AI execute a specific strategy?
2. **Fair Comparison**: Each AI uses its own analytical capabilities
3. **Transparent Parameters**: Clear, measurable differences
4. **Educational**: Users learn about trading strategies

### ❌ What This Approach Doesn't Do

1. **Impose Personalities**: No "Claude is cautious" labels
2. **Limit AI Potential**: Each AI can reason freely within strategy
3. **Make Assumptions**: No stereotyping of AI models
4. **Hide Parameters**: Everything is explicit and measurable
